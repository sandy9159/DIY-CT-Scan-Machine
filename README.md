Hello friends in this video I have made something unique, CT Scan machine toy. using arduino and some motors.

I have imitate the mechanical function of CT Scan or MRI machine how table slide inside the tunnel how magnetic resonance disc rotate around the table.

I have also added a small screen for more fun I have displayed a series of images on display so it will look more amazing.

This is not at all near to a real CT scan Machine this is just a science toy made for fun.

First, we will see what is CT Scan machine

A CT scan machine, or computed tomography scanner, is a medical imaging device that uses X-rays to create detailed cross-sectional images of the body. It provides a more comprehensive and detailed view of internal structures than traditional X-ray images.

Here's how a CT scan machine works:

1. X-ray Generation:** The CT scanner consists of an X-ray tube and detectors that are placed on opposite sides of the rotating gantry. The patient lies on a motorized table that moves through the gantry.

2. X-ray Beams and Detectors:** The X-ray tube emits a series of narrow beams that pass through the body. Detectors on the opposite side of the patient measure the amount of radiation that makes it through the body.

3. Data Acquisition:** As the gantry rotates around the patient, multiple X-ray projections are obtained from different angles. These projections are converted into digital signals by the detectors.

4. Computer Processing:** A computer processes the digital signals and uses mathematical algorithms to reconstruct detailed cross-sectional images, or slices, of the body. These slices can be viewed individually or stacked to create a 3D representation.

CT scans are valuable in diagnosing a variety of conditions and injuries, including:

- Trauma:** Detecting injuries to bones, organs, and soft tissues.

- Cancer:** Identifying and locating tumors.

- Vascular Imaging:** Examining blood vessels and blood flow.

- Infections:** Locating and characterizing infections.

- Internal Bleeding:** Identifying sources of internal bleeding.

CT scans are versatile and widely used in medical settings for their ability to provide detailed images of internal structures. However, they do involve exposure to ionizing radiation, so healthcare professionals carefully weigh the benefits against the risks when recommending CT scans. In some cases, alternative imaging techniques, such as MRI or ultrasound, may be considered based on the specific clinical requirements.

The Nema 17 stepper motor is controlled by an A4988 stepper motor driver. The A4988 driver is set to operate the stepper motor in 16th steps mode, which provides precise and smooth motion control.
Wiring the A4988 Driver to the Arduino:
The step pin (for controlling the step movement) of the A4988 driver is connected to the A1 pin on the Arduino. This connection ensures that the Arduino can send step commands to the stepper motor through the driver.
The direction pin (for controlling the rotation direction) of the A4988 driver is connected to the A0 pin on the Arduino. This connection allows the Arduino to determine the direction in which the stepper motor should rotate.
Power Supply for Stepper Motor:
The stepper motor is powered by a 12V DC power supply. This voltage level is suitable for the Nema 17 stepper motor's operation, providing the necessary power for its movements.

Here you can see how to work in a common configuration. 

Speed range go from 0 to 255, default is 100.
Use setSpeed(speed) to change.

Sometimes at lower speed motors seems not running.
It's normal, may depends by motor and power supply.
